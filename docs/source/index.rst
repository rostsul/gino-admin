Version 0.0.11 Updates
----------------------

1. Added possibility to define custom route to Gino Admin Panel. With 'route=' config setting
By default, used '/admin' route

2. Added Demo Panel  `Gino-Admin demo`_ - you can log in and play with it. Login & pass - admin / 1234
If you don't see any data in UI maybe somebody before you cleaned it - go to Presets and load one of the data presets.
