**v0.3.0**

### New Features:

1. Added support for 'hide_columns' argument in admin panel configuration, example: examples/base_example/src/app.py

Argument removes those columns from admin panel 'edit' section. 
You can pass column directly for one model, or global hide by name, for example:  

hide_columns = [ModelName.id, 'pk']

This mean that for the model ModelName on 'edit' page column 'id' will be hided. 
And globally for all models will be hided columns with name 'pk'.
